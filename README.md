# FlowCharter
Temporarily, the FlowCharter is a customerizable GUI program designed for drawing flow chart.

The idol of this program is Visio. So that, all the operation methods would be similar (the direction of its designer) as Visio.

This program is a off-work & non-profit project driven by personal interest. The design purpose is just to practice/enhance coding skill&brain. 

All the methods, ideas, implements are original.
One can read, use and modify the code to satisfy your personal purpose.
The FlowCharter designer(s) will not be responsible for the tort made by anyone else.

Welcome each advice/instruction from you and welcome everyone to jion into the development.
