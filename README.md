# FlowCharter
Temporarily, the FlowCharter is a customerizable GUI program designed for drawing flow chart.

The idol of this program is Visio. So that, all the operation methods would be similar (just the direction of its designer) than Visio.

This program is a off-work project driven by personal interest. The design purpose is to practice/enhance coding skill&brain. 

All the methods, ideas, implements are original.
You can read, use and modify the code to satisfy your personal purpose, but the FlowCharter designer(s) is not responsible for the tort made by you.

Welcome each advice/instruction from you and welcome everyone to jion into the development.
